     <h1>Welcome to Materials Modelling Group</h1>

    <h2>Advancing Methodological Excellence In Africa at the MMG: ICTP-PWF Methodological School On Density Functional Theory</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://materials-modelling-group.github.io/">Materials Modeling Group</a> 
            is hosting the third event of the year long APhRICA program, with an emphasis on methodological 
            aspects of DFT. In the school are a total of 17 participants, from 7 different countries, including Kenya,  
            with lecturers drawn from Kenya, France and Italy. 
            The aim of this event is extensive methodological training, taking the participants beyond an introduction to 
            the field of condensed matter, and giving them in depth lectures on advanced theoretical knowledge in Density Functional Theory.
        </p>

        <p>
            A key outcome of this overall project would be, after the completion of this initiative, that it will no longer 
            be necessary for such advanced training to be conducted by experts from outside the continent, but the knowledge 
            will be resident in local experts. In-depth subject matter expertise is still to a great extent undeveloped in the 
            region, and this is a shortcoming that other parallel efforts have been unable to address. 

            This event has received support from the CNR-ISM, the Abdus Salaam ICTP, the CNRS and facilitation from the Technical University of
            Kenya, Masinde Muliro University and Moi University.

    <h2>Erasmus+ Call</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://materials-modelling-group.github.io/">Materials Modeling Group</a> 
            of the Department of Physics, Earth and Environment Science at The Technical 
            University of Kenya, has been nominated to participate in an Erasmus+
            research mobility grant in partnership with University of Cantabria in Spain.
            A call for expression of interest for participation is made with the 
            following requirements: 
        </p>

        <h4>Applicant Profile</h4>
        <p>Students at their first year Msc in Physics or equivalent and above can apply, 
            with a demonstrable interest and knowledge of materials modeling and a continuing
            interest in Computational Physics. A strong knowledge and experience in using the 
            Linux environment, as well as working with peers will be a benefit. Students 
            located in TU-K are encouraged to apply.
        </p>

        <h4>Activities and Outcomes</h4>
        <p>The program during the year, will involve active participation in research and academic
        activities, including a visit to a research collaborator. During the research visit to 
        collaborators, the beneficiary’s costs will be covered by the program’s budget.
        </p>

        <h4>Applications, Dealine and More Information</h4>
        <p>Please send your CV and relevant documentation of your academic qualifications to
        <a href="mailto:erasmus-tukmmg-23@tukenya.ac.ke">erasmus-tukmmg-23@tukenya.ac.ke</a>.
         All applications must be sent on or before <strong>17th of April 2025</strong>.
